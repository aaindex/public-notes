Q: Why curl -v -k "https://localhost:9443/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=AodKBACDZTYwzXa24IUCboyOrhGO8a&redirect_uri=https://localhost:8082/login/oauth2/code/oauth2-login-8082&scope=openid" does not generate an access token?

A: The reason you don't see an access token being generated from the curl command to the /oauth2/authorize endpoint is because this specific step in the OAuth2 Authorization Code flow is only meant to obtain an authorization code, not an access token. The flow involves multiple steps, and the authorization code is just an intermediary step. Here's a breakdown of the flow:

OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow Steps:

    1. Authorization Request: The client (your application) redirects the user to the authorization server's (WSO2) /oauth2/authorize endpoint. This is where you are currently at in the process. This step is intended for the user to authenticate (log in) and authorize the application. If successful, the authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an authorization code in the query parameters of the redirect URI.

    2. Authorization Code Retrieval: The client receives the request at the redirect URI, extracts the authorization code from the query parameters, and proceeds to the next step. This is a manual process when testing with curl since curl cannot automatically handle the redirection and extraction of the code from the query parameters. In a real-world application, this is handled programmatically by your backend server or through front-end logic.

    3. Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token: With the authorization code in hand, the client makes a server-to-server request to the authorization server's token endpoint, /oauth2/token, including the authorization code, client ID, and client secret. This is the step where the access token is actually requested.

Why You Don't See an Access Token:

    The /oauth2/authorize endpoint is designed for user interaction and does not directly return an access token. Instead, it returns an authorization code, assuming the user successfully logs in and consents to the authorization request.
    The actual access token is obtained in a separate request to the /oauth2/token endpoint, which must include the authorization code, client ID, and client secret.

Next Steps to Get an Access Token:

    Complete the User Authentication Flow: Typically, you would redirect a user to the /oauth2/authorize URL in a web browser. After login and consent, the user would be redirected to the redirect_uri you specified, with an authorization code appended to it.
    Extract the Authorization Code: From the user's redirection back to your application, extract the authorization code from the query parameters.
    Request an Access Token: Use the extracted authorization code to make a curl request (or through your application's backend) to the token endpoint. For example:

    curl -v -k -X POST https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
     -d "code=THE_AUTHORIZATION_CODE_YOU_RECEIVED" \
     -d "redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI" \
     -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
     -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
